# music-app
This is a music-app where you can update the music and edit the music. I have add the sort functionality in this app so that you can easily search your interest.
For the data I use local json-server. If you want to use this app first you have to clone this repo and run the json-server locally than you are able see the UI of the app
and also you can able to edit and update the music.


MainPage : you can see in the left side sort functionality and the right-side all the music.
